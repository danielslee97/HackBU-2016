# HackBU-2016
Website that was designed for hackathon in Binghamton University, 2016. It has the theme of Valentine's Day because the hackathon was during February 14, 2016. The website prints out compliments for person pressing the button. The button is meant for people not in a relationship. This website is intended to make single people feel better about themselves.
